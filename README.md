The data was collected many moons ago and analysed with Matlab. Iâ€™ve tried to export the summary data to CSV files to be more accessible to others. In Experiment 3, the archived data in my backup does not match the N reported in the paper (I have 24, paper reports 27). This could be down trimming outliers differently or not saving the full data by the first author.

The study is organised into three experiments:

* Experiment 1 is about rating 110 short instrument sounds from MUMS in terms of affects
* Experiment 2 is a subset of the Experiment 2 sounds that were rated without hearing the sounds (imagery condition)
* Experiment 3 is a set of 105 sounds from VSL that have various dynamic and timbral alterations. These were rated in the same way as Experiment 1.
