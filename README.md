The study is organised into three experiments:

* Experiment 1 relates to [Durham Chord Dataset](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/DCD)
* Experiment 2 to the analysis of three datasets (`lah20a`,`lah20b`,`pop19`)
* Experiment 3 to the analysis of nine datasets

The data is kept in the `data` folder of this repository as csv files. The exception is DCD data for Experiment 1, which is found in [DCD](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/DCD), also stored as csv file. 

The R scripts will replicate all analyses in the manuscript and offer several alternative analyses. You can access the compiled output (results, figures) of the analyses at the [docs](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/anatomy-of-consonance/), which is created by [README.Rmd](README.Rmd) file.
